**Key features**:
- No code changes are made
- Immediate context-aware help
- Perfect for understanding existing code


#### Edit Mode - Surgical Code Updates
**When to use**: Specific, controlled changes to defined files

**Key features**:
- You choose which files can be modified
- Shows diffs before applying changes
- Full control over each edit


#### Agent Mode - Autonomous Development Partner
**When to use**: Complex, multi-step tasks requiring iteration

**Key features**:
- Autonomously determines files to modify
- Runs terminal commands (with approval)
- Iterates until task completion
- Self-corrects errors


**Agent Mode Tips**:
- Use custom instructions to define coding standards
- Be specific about requirements
- Review the autonomous changes carefully
- Use the undo feature if needed

### Part 2: Enhanced Features

#### Screenshot Integration
Copilot Chat supports image attachments for visual context:

**Use cases**:
1. **Design feedback**: Take a screenshot of your current UI, attach it, and ask: "Make this header more modern with a gradient background"
2. **Bug reports**: Screenshot an error and ask: "Why is this visualization not rendering correctly?"
3. **Mockup implementation**: Attach a design mockup and request: "Generate the HTML and CSS to match this design"

- Switch to Claude 4 for complex refactoring or architectural decisions
- Experiment to find which model works best for your coding style

### Part 3: Basic Improvements - Learning the Fundamentals

#### 1. CSS Organization (Beginner)
**Goal**: Extract embedded CSS from `index.html` to `styles.css`

**Learning Points**:
- Using Copilot Chat's "Edit" mode
- Understanding file context selection
- Basic refactoring with AI assistance

**Exercise**:
1. Open both `index.html` and `styles.css` in your editor
2. Switch to Edit mode in Copilot Chat
3. Add both files to the context
4. Prompt: "Move all CSS from the style tag in index.html to styles.css while maintaining the same visual appearance"

#### 2. Theme Customization (Beginner)
**Goal**: Update fonts and color scheme

**Exercise Ideas**:
- Change to a modern font stack
- Update color palette to match university branding
- Adjust spacing and typography

**Prompting Strategy**:
```
"Update the color scheme to use [specific colors] for headers and 
[specific colors] for backgrounds. Change the font to [font name] 
and ensure good contrast for accessibility."
```

#### 3. Performance Optimization (Intermediate)
**Goal**: Cache the temperature distribution plot

**Using Agent Mode**:
1. Switch to Agent mode
2. Prompt: "Implement caching for the temperature distribution plot. Save it as a static image that regenerates every hour."
3. Watch as Copilot:
   - Analyzes the current implementation
   - Creates necessary directories
   - Implements caching logic
   - Adds cache invalidation

### Part 5: Intermediate Features - Building User Experience

#### 4. Dark Mode Implementation (Intermediate)
**Goal**: Add a toggle-able dark mode

**Progressive Approach with Edit Mode**:
1. Start: "Add a dark mode toggle button to the header"
2. Enhance: "Save the user's dark mode preference in localStorage"
3. Polish: "Add smooth transitions between light and dark modes"

**Screenshot Enhancement**:
- Take a screenshot after implementing basic dark mode
- Attach it and ask: "The dark mode looks too harsh. Make the colors more subtle with better contrast"

#### 5. Temperature Unit Converter (Intermediate)
**Goal**: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit

**Demonstrating Prompting Excellence**:

**Basic Prompt**: 
"Add temperature converter"

**Better Prompt**: 
"Add a toggle button that converts all temperature displays between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Update the chart, statistics, and table data."

**Best Prompt with Context Questions**:
"I want to add a temperature unit converter to my weather dashboard. Before implementing, please ask me 3 questions about the specific requirements and user experience I'm looking for."

### Part 6: Advanced Features - Modern Web Development

#### 6. Multi-Page Navigation (Advanced)
**Goal**: Create a tabbed interface with multiple views

**Using Agent Mode**:
```
"Create a multi-page Flask application with:
- A navigation menu with Home, Statistics, Historical Trends, and About pages
- Use Flask blueprints for better organization
- Maintain consistent styling across all pages
- Add active page highlighting in the navigation"
```

#### 7. Modern UI Overhaul (Advanced)
**Goal**: Transform the dashboard into a contemporary web application

**Demonstrating Detailed Prompting**:

**Vague Prompt** (Don't do this):
"Make the site modern"

**Detailed Prompt** (Do this):
"Redesign the weather dashboard with a modern aesthetic:
- Use a card-based layout with subtle shadows (box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
- Implement a sticky navigation header with backdrop-filter blur
- Add hover animations (transform: translateY(-2px) on hover)
- Use a gradient color palette (#1a1a2e to #16213e)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with CSS Grid
- Include skeleton loaders for data fetching states
- Add micro-interactions for all buttons and links"

## Prompting Best Practices

Based on prompt engineering principles ([source](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements)), effective prompts contain key elements that guide AI responses:

### 1. Core Prompt Elements
- **Instruction**: Clear directive of what you want Copilot to do
- **Context**: Relevant background information about your project
- **Input Data**: Specific code, files, or examples to work with
- **Output Indicator**: Expected format or structure of the response

**Example applying all elements**:
```
[Instruction] Refactor this authentication function to use JWT tokens
[Context] This is part of a Flask app with 1000+ daily users
[Input Data] Current function uses session-based auth in app.py lines 45-67
[Output Indicator] Provide the updated function with error handling and comments
```

### 2. Advanced Prompting Techniques ([source](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/tips))

**Be Specific and Detailed**
- ❌ "Fix the bug"
- ✅ "Fix the TypeError on line 23 when user_data is None by adding proper null checking"

**Use Examples (Few-shot prompting)**
```
"Convert this function to use async/await pattern like this example:
# Sync version
def get_data(): return requests.get(url)
# Async version
async def get_data(): return await aiohttp.get(url)

Now convert my fetch_weather() function similarly"
```

**Structure Complex Tasks**
Break down large requests into steps:
```
"Help me implement user authentication:
1. First, create a User model with email and hashed password
2. Then, add registration endpoint with validation
3. Finally, implement JWT token generation on login"
```

**Specify Constraints**
```
"Add error logging to all API endpoints, but:
- Use Python's built-in logging module only
- Keep log files under 10MB
- Include timestamp, endpoint, and user ID"
```

### 3. Iteration Strategies
- Start simple, then refine: "Add a navbar" → "Make it sticky" → "Add mobile menu"
- Request alternatives: "Show me 2 different ways to implement this"
- Ask for explanations: "Explain why you chose this approach"

## Context Management Strategies

Effective context management is crucial for accurate AI responses ([source](https://www.promptingguide.ai/guides/context-engineering-guide)):

### 1. Context Window Optimization
**Include What Matters**:
- Primary file being modified
- Related dependencies (imports, utilities)
- Configuration files when relevant
- Test files for TDD approaches

**Exclude Noise**:
- Unrelated modules
- Large data files
- Generated or minified code
- Cached or temporary files

### 2. Context Engineering Techniques

**Explicit File References**
```
"In templates/index.html, update the header section to match 
the new design in static/mockup.png, using styles from static/styles.css"
```

**Hierarchical Context**
Start broad, then narrow:
```
"We're building a weather dashboard with Flask.
The app.py handles API calls to NOAA.
Focus on the get_weather_data() function that needs caching."
```

**Dynamic Context Loading**
For complex features:
1. Start with core files
2. Add dependencies as needed
3. Remove files once changes are complete
4. Keep context focused on current task


### 3. Context Best Practices
- **New chat for new features**: Prevents context pollution
- **Reference specific sections**: "In the handleSubmit function..." 
- **State assumptions clearly**: "Assuming we're using Bootstrap 5..."
- **Update context progressively**: Add files as the conversation evolves

## Advanced Tips

### Premium Requests and Billing
Each time you send a prompt in a chat window or trigger a response from Copilot, you're making a request. Some Copilot features use more advanced processing power and count as premium requests.

**Managing Premium Requests**:
- Premium request counters reset on the 1st of each month at 00:00:00 UTC.
- Monitor usage in VS Code status bar or GitHub settings
- Additional premium requests beyond your plan's included amount are billed at $0.04 USD per request.
- Set spending limits to control costs

### Response Customization
While out of scope for this workshop, be aware that GitHub Copilot supports:
- Custom instructions per repository
- Team-specific coding standards
- Automated response patterns
